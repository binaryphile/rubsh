# Rubsh

Ruby-inspired datatype enhancements for bash - pronounced "rubbish"

Rubsh is a trashy attempt at making bash scripting a bit more ruby-ish.

When sourced, rubsh adds a set of functions to your bash environment
that allow you to do ruby-like operations with data types.  The
underlying bash semantics are unchanged, so you can mix rubsh-y code
with regular bash to your heart's content.

Why?  Bash is pretty annoying, but it's really good at system-level
manipulation and it's on every platform.  Rubsh makes it only slightly
less annoying to work with.
